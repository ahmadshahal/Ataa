    <string name="why_we_volunteer_text">What is volunteering? It is the provision of assistance, aid and effort in order to work towards achieving goodness in society in general and to its members in particular. It was called voluntary work because a person does it voluntarily without being forced by others to do it. It is an inner will, and the power of good prevails over evil, and evidence of the prosperity of society. Why do we volunteer? Expand your circle of acquaintances and make new friends: Volunteering is a great option when it comes to providing yourself with a new opportunity in different areas of life that gives you the ability to meet new people, expand your contacts and help you step out of your comfort zone, making you more confident and increasing your social skills and ability to communicate effectively with your surroundings. complacency When was the last time you made someone happy and put a smile on their face? Wasn\'t that awesome! We believe that volunteering is the best way to provide self-satisfaction by making an impact in the lives of others. Changing the lives of others, even a small amount, gives a sense of importance to your person and gives you a reason to live.</string>
